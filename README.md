# Call Center Dashboard

During my virtual internship with PwC, I developed a comprehensive Call Center Dashboard designed to enhance the operational efficiency and performance monitoring of a call center. This project aimed to provide a centralized platform for real-time data visualization and analysis, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.

Objectives
Real-time Data Visualization: To create an intuitive dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time.

Performance Monitoring: To track and analyze call center metrics such as call volume, average handling time, and customer satisfaction.

Operational Efficiency: To identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in call center operations.

User-Friendly Interface: To design a dashboard that is easy to navigate and understand for various stakeholders, including managers and executives.

Conclusion
This project provided me with valuable experience in data analytics, dashboard development, and project management. It also showcased the practical application of technology in solving real-world business challenges, aligning with PwC's commitment to innovation and excellence.
